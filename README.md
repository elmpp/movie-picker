## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

I need a job. Spending this much time in the library isn't healthy

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

As you'll quickly notice have gone with a managed expo project here as time is of
the essence and there's to be no funky low-level stuff. Also, honestly, it's
a chance to see how expo's react-native-web integration has been going.

- git checkout -> `yarn install`
- For mobile: `yarn start` (usual managed expo options then arise)
- For web: `yarn web` (Perhaps play around with the browser window as it's responsive)
